# SequenceFactorBenchmark
SeqFactorBench is a controlled benchmark for evaluating sequence models under compounded difficulty. It stresses scale, breadth, structural dependency, and noise independently and in combination, exposing failure modes that isolated benchmarks miss and clarifying real-world robustness limits across sequence architectures.
